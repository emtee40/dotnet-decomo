A 'small' TODO list for features/improvements/issues that need to be resolved for this port.

- Try to reduce 'string' object allocations by using a 'StringBuilder' instead, especially in the TypeSystem
- Implement all the MethodBodyDebugInfoBuilder and other dnSpy debug info specific classes and annotations.
- Add all the relevant dnSpy specific options into the decompiler, for example: always showing compiler generated members.
- If decompilation of a method body fails, we should just write the exception as a multi line comment inside the body instead of crashing the entire decompiler.
- Difficult by worth a try: We could try to reuse some of the instances of classes for multiple decompilation runs instead of reallocating.
- Proper implementation of 'IDocumentationProvider'.
- Add MemberRef annotations to the generated C# AST. (Some missing places marked with 'TODO').
- Add 'ILSpan' annotations required by dnSpy to the generated C# AST.
- Some of the types in 'KnownTypeCode' are present in dnlib's CorLibTypes. We should use those instead as it is probably more efficient then searching the entire type system.
- Make sure none of the required annotations have been removed throughout C# AST transforms.
- Fix ITypeParameter OriginalMember, MetadataToken and MDGenericParam, these don't always work
